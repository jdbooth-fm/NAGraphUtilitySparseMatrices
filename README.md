# NAGraphUtilitySparseMatrices
Code repo for paper: Neural Acceleration of Graph Based Utility Functions for Sparse Matrices
The two base codes are provided for the GRU and the GNN models.
These two base codes can be modified to fit all the mdoels tested in the paper.
Due to the dataset size, the dataset has not been included on github.
The dataset is available on request to joshua.booth@uah.edu
